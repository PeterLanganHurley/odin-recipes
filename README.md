The current project is to create a basic recipes website.

During the creation of the recipes website, I demonstrated a variety of skills that I learned over the course of the HTML Foundations lessons. I created multiple HTML files, each with their own unique headings, paragraphs, and lists. As well, I practiced adding and committing my code to GitHub. I'm looking forward to learning CSS and giving my website some flair in the future.
