    <h2>Grilled shrimp with fettucine pasta and roasted red pepper sauce</h2>
        <p>This scrumptious seafood dish is sure to wow your dinner guests! The recipe can be broken down into three steps: the pasta, the shrimp, and the sauce. Thinking about the recipe this way makes it easier when it comes time to cook!!</p>
        <p>Another great thing about this dish is that you can substitute your favorite pasta! I prefer fettucine, but feel free to use penne or ravioli instead! I recommend a longer noodle like tagliatelle or pappardelle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>2 lb shrimp</li>
            <li>16 oz fettucine pasta</li>

                <li>Reduce the heat to low and remove the shrimp from the pan. To the same pan, add the pureed roasted pepper. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring often.</li>
