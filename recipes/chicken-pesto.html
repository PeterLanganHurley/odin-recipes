    <h2>Grilled chicken with penne pasta and pesto sauce</h2>
        <p>This yummy meal is a great recipe that will impress your friends, but is surpsingly simple! The recipe can be broken down into three steps: the pasta, the chicken, and the pesto. If you think about the recipe this way, it becomes less daunting!</p>
        <p>Another great thing about this dish is that you can substitute your favorite pasta! Penne is my personal favorite, but if you prefer linguine or spaghetti, feel free to use that instead! I recommend a a longer noodle like linguine, or one with plenty of twists and grooves, like farfalle.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb chicken thighs</li>
            <li>16 oz penne pasta</li>
            <li>2 cups fresh basil</li>
            <li>1/2 cup grated parmesan</li>
            <li>1 cup olive oil</li>
            <li>1/3 cup pine nuts</li>
            <li>3 cloves garlic</li>
            <li>1/8 tsp black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
            <li>1/2 tbsp Italian seasoning</li>
        </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of water to boil and cook the penne according to the instructions. Sprinkle a few pinches of salt into the water before adding the pasta. Drain and set aside after the pasta finishes boiling, but save 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken thighs on a cutting board. Cut into nice even strips, and cover with 2 tbsp Italian seasoning.</li>
                <li>Heat 1 tbsp olive oil in a non-stick pan over medium heat. Let the pan heat 2-3 minutes before adding the olive oil.</li>
                <li>Place the chopped chicken thighs on the pan and sear for 5 minutes. Flip and sear the other side for 5 more minutes. Remove from pan and set aside once cooked.</li>
                <li>In a food processor or blender, add the basil, parmesan, olive oil, pine nuts, garlic cloves, salt, and pepper. Blend until thoroughly mixed - the pesto should be pleasant shades of green without any obvious outstanding clumps of cheese or nuts.</li>
                <li>Remove the pesto and place into a bowl, and mix in some of the pasta water. Stir and repeat until the pesto is smooth, and not clumpy. IMPORTANT: you do not need to use the entire 1 cup of pasta water.</li>
                <li>Place the chicken, pasta, and pesto in a serving bowl.</li>
                <li>Enjoy!</li>
            </ol>
